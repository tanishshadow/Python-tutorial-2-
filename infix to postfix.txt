Infix to Postfix(using stack)
Steps:
● Put Brackets at appropriate positions.
● If there’s a Left bracket, push it in the stack.
If there’s an operator, push it in the stack.
If there’s a character, add it to the string.
If there’s a Right Bracket, pop from stack until the left bracket is
popped.
● Conversion done when the stack is empty.
